  <h3>Currently Offering Virtual Cocktail Classes During Quarantine</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classes: Pre-Prohibition, Post-Prohibition, Whiskey Cocktails 1, and more to come...</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>In these classes, I introduce you to the same creative process we as bar conssultants use every time we develop a new cocktail menu for a new/existing bar/restaurant.
        You'll mix up and enjoy two seemingly "familiar" cocktails, using them as examples to understand the structure, balance and composition. I'll explain
        the language to customize these structures to your own whim while still creating a balanced end product. While this description probably reads pretty damn dry in this HTML format while I learn how to code,
        I promise the class is anything but dry as we shake, sip, discuss and joke our way to our third and final cocktail where you get to introduce in real-time your flavors and apply
        everything you learned in the class. Let's get social during social distancing! Check out my <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ice_and_alchemy/">Instagram</a></strong> for images, updates and link to my Eventbrite in the bio. Cheers!</li>
